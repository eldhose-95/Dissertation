### ANALYSING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF CORRELATION-BASED FEATURE SELECTION COMPARED TO TRADITIONAL METHODS FOR CHURN PREDICTION

Feature selection is a crucial step in the development of predictive models in machine learning. Traditionally, backward and forward stepwise selection, LASSO, and optimal selection have been employed to identify the most relevant features. However, these methods can be computationally intensive and complex. This research seeks to empirically determine whether feature selection based on correlations is competitive with traditional methods in terms of prediction quality, runtime, and ease of use.

The LASSO method enhances the predictive accuracy and interpretability of statistical models by applying an L1 penalty to the coefficients, which can reduce some of them to zero, thereby enabling variable selection (Tibshirani, 1996). This feature makes it particularly useful for high-dimensional datasets where the number of predictors exceeds the number of observations. On the other hand, correlation-based feature selection ranks variables based on their correlation with the target variable, making it computationally efficient and empirically successful in various studies (Guyon & Elisseeff, 2003). In supervised learning, the Forward-Backward Selection (FBS) algorithm is widely used for its simplicity and broad applicability to different data types. The FBS algorithm includes a forward phase to add variables that improve model performance and a backward phase to remove variables that do not contribute to model improvement. Despite its utility, FBS is challenged by high computational costs and a tendency toward multiple testing problems, which can result in overfitting and the selection of irrelevant variables (Borboudakis & Tsamardinos, 2019). However, there is a lack of comprehensive studies comparing the effectiveness of correlation-based feature selection with traditional methods across different types of machine learning algorithms. This research aims to fill this gap by evaluating the performance of correlation-based feature selection against methods such as stepwise selection, LASSO, and optimal selection across various algorithms including random forests, decision trees, regressions, and XGBoost.
